Clean out a flat area of land, remove all stones, and plants.
Place on each side 4x 0.25 long bamboo sticks and put the 4.65m long stick on top
Add four of the 0.6m long sticks on each side and start with the knot
Place first bamboo stick on the left and wrap rope around the horizontal stick
Pass both ends of the rope under the rope that we initially placed and tie a simple knot
Pull the knot tight and continue by wrapping the sticks diagonally
Wrap diagonally four times, then switch to the opposite diagonal direction
Wrap the rope around the bamboo at least four more times, then pass the rope under the initial loops
Pass the rope under the vertical bamboo and pull tight
Place the next bamboo to the right and repeat the process for this stick
Place the third bamboo stick to the right and repeat it again. Finish with a simple knot
Repeat the whole process for the stick below
After finishing the first end continue with the three others
Take 4 bamboo sticks each 2.50 meters long place 2 horizontally place the other 2 vertically on top
Start the knot with a simple loop
Wrap the rope around the horizontal pole, then pass it under the vertical pole
Repeat this about for times
Finish the it with a simple knot
Repeat the same rope connection for the 3 remaining ends. Start putting the longer sticks in place
Connect the top end with the frame work
Start with a simple knot
Wrap the three sticks multiple times
Wrap the rope around the gaps between the three sticks to make it more stable, finish with a knot
Add two more connections to make the frame more stable
One on the right
And one on the left
Place 2 more vertical sticks on top
Start the knot with a simple loop
Wrap the rope around the horizontal pole, then pass it under the vertical pole
Repeat this about for times
Finish the it with a simple knot
Repeat the same rope connection for the 3 remaining ends
After the first bamboo frame is completed, the entire structure is erected
Next, the 1.00 meter long wooden stakes need to be driven into the ground
The easiest way is for two people to drive the stakes into the ground
Make sure to drive them at least 0.30m in the ground
Proceed with the next bamboo frame and construct it following the previous steps
Make sure the distance between the frames is around 0.85m
The spacing between de stakes should be around 0.15m
Construct the remaining bamboo frames until all 5 of them are correctly placed
Begin bracing by laying the 4.65m horizontal bars on the frames
Add the second bamboo bar on the top and connect frame and rope with a knot
Continue with placing additional horizontal bracing on top of the diagonal elements
Put additional horizontal stakes below the diagonal elements
Add 4 stakes to place the floor on top later
To finish the bracing add the diagonal elements
Connect them with a rope with the structure
Start installing the roof panels on the structure. Put a metal sheet below the ridge
Make sure to connect the nails with the middle bamboo stick
Overlap the sheets.
Use umbrella or twisted roofing nails.
Finish the first side of the roof.
Make sure that the ridge panels are overlapping
Add the second half of the roof
Make sure to connect the nails with the middle bamboo stick
Start adding the aluminium cladding
Add the nails as shown in the graphic
Finish the first side
Add the cladding to the other side of the shelter
Add the nails as shown in the graphic
Install the wooden floor
Add aluminium cladding to the front and the back side of the shelter. The shelter is finished
The shelter is finished
